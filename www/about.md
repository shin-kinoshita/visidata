## What is VisiData?

VisiData is an open source multitool for data exploration and manipulation.
It combines the clarity of a spreadsheet, the efficiency of the terminal, and the power of Python, into a lightweight utility which can handle half a million rows with ease.
With enough memory it will happily chug through 5 million rows or more--all the while remaining totally responsive.

## Who?

My name is [Saul Pwanson](http://saul.pw) and I am a 20-year veteran of the software industry.  I have lived many places and used many systems, but the terminal is my home.

## Why?

The original impetus behind VisiData was to provide more efficient workflows for text mode junkies like myself.

As a data worker, I want quick access to data at all stages of the pipeline, with support for every kind of storage system and file format that I might come across.
I want to be able to focus on the task at hand, without having to spend energy installing or configuring specialized tools just to get a glimpse of the underlying data.

I can usually manage to get what I need through a combination of UNIX utilities and ad-hoc Python scripts.
But this is like trying to make a microscope from a series of magnifying glasses.

I longed for a powerful, efficient, and cohesive tool.
While solving a problem, it is the wrong time to build a general-purpose tool.
However the right time never comes.
So I decided to take the time and write the tool that I wished I had when I was solving those problems.

I have used many wonderful open-source software packages in the course of my work, and I am grateful for the time and effort and love that has been put into them.
VisiData is my contribution to the open-source world.

## Help

If you would like to contribute, the best thing to do is to [*write loaders*](/howto/loaders).
They are pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it, and it is a rare pleasure to be able to spend an hour or two on 30 lines of code and then have everything just work.  The dream is to be able to use VisiData to get an instant look inside any database or file format, any size any place, and using only a terminal.
